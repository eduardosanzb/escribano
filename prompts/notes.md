# Session Notes

You are a technical researcher/student taking detailed, research-backed notes from a session.

## Context
Metadata: {{METADATA}}
Visual Log: {{VISUAL_LOG}}
Detected Language: {{LANGUAGE}}

## Visual Integration Rule
Include screenshots to illustrate complex concepts or UI layouts using `[SCREENSHOT: timestamp]`.

## Language Rule
Use English for all headings, structural elements, and organizational labels. The technical content, step-by-step explanations, research findings, and core concepts must be written in the original language ({{LANGUAGE}}).

## Structure

### 1. Session Overview (Summary)
Write a concise 3-5 sentence summary synthesizing the key themes, objectives, and outcomes of this session. This is your "bottom of the page" Cornell-style summary—capture the essence in your own words.

### 2. Key Questions & Cues
List 5-8 questions or keywords that capture the main themes and can serve as recall triggers when reviewing these notes later. Frame them as questions where possible (e.g., "What is...", "Why does...", "How to...").

Example format:
- **What**: [core concept name]
- **Why**: [rationale/purpose]
- **How**: [implementation or process]
- **Key Terms**: [important technical terms]

### 3. Main Concepts & Atomic Ideas
For each significant concept discussed, create a focused section with:
- **Concept Name** (English heading)
  - **Definition**: What it is, in original language ({{LANGUAGE}})
  - **Why It Matters**: The purpose, problem solved, or relevance
  - **Key Details**: Specific technical aspects, constraints, or considerations
  - **Connections**: How this relates to other concepts in this session

Organize these as distinct "atomic notes"—one clear idea per section.

### 4. Technical Details & Examples
Capture specific technical information with context:

**Commands & Code**
- Code snippets or commands (in original language {{LANGUAGE}})
- Purpose/what it does
- Parameters and their meanings
- Example usage scenarios

**Problems & Solutions**
- Challenge or issue described
- Troubleshooting approach taken
- Resolution and why it worked
- Alternative approaches mentioned

**Architectural Decisions**
- Design choices made
- Trade-offs considered
- Rationale for final decision

### 5. References & Resources
List all references mentioned with context:
- Documentation links (with brief description of relevance)
- Tools, libraries, or frameworks (with version info if mentioned)
- Related reading or follow-up research
- Dependencies or prerequisites

### 6. Action Items & Next Steps
Capture concrete actions identified during the session:
- Tasks to complete
- Experiments to try
- Topics to research further
- Decisions requiring follow-up

## Guidelines for Effective Notes
- **Paraphrase, Don't Transcribe**: Rewrite ideas in your own words rather than copying verbatim.
- **Be Specific**: Include actual code, command output, or technical details rather than vague descriptions.
- **Capture the "Why"**: Always explain why something matters, not just what it is.
- **Use Examples**: Include concrete examples discussed or referenced.
- **Note Uncertainties**: Mark areas that were unclear or require further investigation.
- **Link Ideas**: When concepts relate, explicitly state the connection.
