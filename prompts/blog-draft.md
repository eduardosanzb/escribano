## Instructions

1. **Language Rule**: Use English for headings and structural elements. The actual narrative content, quotes, and creative storytelling must remain in the original language ({{LANGUAGE}}).

2. **Adopt a Proven Narrative Structure** (choose one based on session content):
   - **Problem-Solution Arc**: Start with a relatable problem → Show struggle/attempted solutions → Describe the breakthrough or key insight → Explain the resolution → Share lessons learned
   - **Hero's Journey**: Introduce a protagonist (could be the speaker, team, or customer) → Present the challenge they face → Describe the guide/mentor or discovery → Show the transformation → Reflect on the journey
   - **Case Study Format**: Set the context/background → Define the challenge → Detail the approach/process → Reveal results → Extract key takeaways

3. **Engagement Techniques**:
   - **Hook your reader immediately** with one of these opening techniques:
     * A compelling anecdote from the session
     * A startling statistic or counterintuitive fact
     * A provocative question that addresses the reader's pain point
     * A "what if" scenario
   - **Create tension early** by establishing the stakes — what's at risk? What problem needs solving?
   - **"Show, don't tell"** throughout — use specific details, examples, and vivid descriptions rather than abstract statements
   - **Build characters** — make the people in the session relatable with specific details, motivations, and perspectives

4. **Scannability for Web Readers**:
   - Use **short paragraphs** (2-3 sentences maximum)
   - Insert **subheadings** every 3-4 paragraphs to guide readers through the narrative
   - Use **bulleted lists** for key points, lessons, or examples
   - Include **a pull quote** or highlighted insight from the transcript that captures the essence
   - Start each paragraph with a **topic sentence** that hints at what follows (Google Developers)

5. **Structure Required**:
   - **Compelling Hook** (opening technique as above)
   - **The Narrative Arc** — logically flowing from beginning to middle to end, with rising action
   - **Key Takeaways** — 3-5 concrete lessons or insights, presented as a bulleted list
   - **Call-to-Action** — give the reader a purposeful next step: "Try this approach," "Apply this insight," "Share your experience," or "Join the conversation"
   - **Conclusion** — reflect on the session's broader impact or future outlook

6. **Tone and Style**:
   - Use **active voice** throughout for clarity and impact
   - Make content **relatable** — connect technical concepts to everyday experiences
   - Balance **authenticity** with polish — preserve genuine moments from the transcript while ensuring flow
   - Aim for **memorable** through surprising insights, emotional resonance, or practical value

7. **Avoid**:
   - Chronological transcript dumps (this is not a transcript)
   - Overly jargon-heavy explanations without context
   - Abstract generalities — ground every point in specific examples from the session
